          <h2 id="definition">What is Gender Inequality?</h2>

          <p class="defintion-text"> Gender inequality is discrimination on the basis of sex or gender causing one sex or gender to be routinely privileged or prioritized over another. This includes harassment/discrimination based on sex, gender identity,or gender expression. Gender discrimination is often rooted in preconceived, false societal and personal notions about what gender is, how gender "should" look, or how gender is performed. For example, many people inaccurately believe that someone's biological sex always determines their gender and therefore their attitudes and behaviors.

          <ul class="Gender Inequality Examples">
            <li>Men are routinely prioritized over women in the workplace.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Women are restricted from working in certain jobs or industries in almost 50% of countries.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Gender inequality in girls education. Even before the pandemic, girls were more likely than boys to
              never set foot in a classroom and be denied equal opportunities.</li>

          <h2 id="why-a-problem">Why is Gender Inequality a Problem?</h2>

          <p>Every day, in every country in the world, women are confronted by discrimination and inequality. They face violence, abuse and unequal treatment at home, at work and in their wider communities â€“ and are denied opportunities to learn, to earn and to lead.

            <br><br>

            Women form the majority of those living in poverty. They have fewer resources, less power and less influence compared to men, and can experience further inequality because of their class, ethnicity and age, as well as religious and other fundamentalism.

            <br><br>

            Gender inequality is a key driver of poverty. And a fundamental denial of women's rights.
